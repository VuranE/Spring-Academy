# Sightseeing app

This project was done as a part of Java/Spring Academy held by TIS GRUPA in September 2024. The goal was to create simple sightseeing app in Spring Boot that has functionalities like: 
* Fetch attractions – Browse available sightseeing locations
* User management – Register and manage users
* Favorites – Save attractions to a personal favorites list
* Rate attractions – Leave ratings and reviews
* Upload images – Add photos to attractions
* Travel journal – Create and manage personal travel entries
